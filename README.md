# Data

The ISIC 2017 dataset is available via https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2017. There are more than 2000 images available in this dataset. 
In this repository, only 150 images from this dataset are added, as an example. The following is available per image:

*	`ISIC_[ID].png` the image of the lesion
*	`ISIC_[ID]\_segmentation.png` the mask of the lesion, showing which pixels belong to the lesion or not
* The label of the image, i.e. whether it belongs to the Melanoma class (0 = no, 1 = yes), and/or the Keratosis class (0 = no, 1 = yes).
